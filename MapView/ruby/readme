Ok, so cardinal is not really ready for production use yet, but I wanted to test interoperability with WinXed.

So, you should load the file "spinning_person_compiled.pir" INSTEAD of "spinning_person.rb".

You can rebuild the pir file via:
  parrot-cardinal --target=pir --output=spinning_person_compiled.pir  spinning_person.rb 

This approach should be generic enough for most Parrot languages that support inheritance (*grumble* lua *grumble*).

#
#NOTE: All cardinal files will try to load "cardinal.pbc", which must be placed in the root directory with all our other 
#      top-level includes. There should be a better way to manage this (text replacement in source files?) but for now
#      it's not such a big deal.
